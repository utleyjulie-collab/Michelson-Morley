                <p class="mb-4">
                    Before Einstein, 19th-century physics had a problem.
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li>Light was known to be a wave.</li>
                    <li>All other waves we know (sound, water) need a <strong>medium</strong> to travel through (air, water).</li>
                    <li>Therefore, physicists assumed light must travel through an invisible, universal medium called the <strong>"luminiferous aether."</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    This aether was thought to be a fixed "background" to the universe. As the Earth orbits the Sun, it must be moving <em>through</em> this aether, creating an <strong>"aether wind,"</strong> just like a car moving on a still day creates its own "wind."
                </p>
                <p class="font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-4">
                    <strong>The Goal:</strong> The Michelson-Morley experiment was designed to <em>detect this aether wind</em>.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    Albert Michelson and Edward Morley built a clever device: the <strong>Michelson Interferometer</strong>.

                    <li><strong>Split the Light:</strong> A single light beam is split into two perpendicular beams (Beam A and Beam B).</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Recombine:</strong> The beams bounce off mirrors, return, and are recombined at a detector.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-2">The Classical Prediction (What They <em>Expected</em> to See)</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Think of it like two boats racing in a river (the "aether wind"):
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Boat A (Parallel):</strong> Goes "upstream" (slowed by the current) and "downstream" (sped up by the current).</li>
                    <li><strong>Boat B (Perpendicular):</strong> Goes "across stream" and back.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    A key (and non-obvious) fact of this analogy is that <strong>the upstream/downstream trip <em>always</em> takes more time than the across-stream trip.</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Therefore, they predicted: <strong>Beam A and Beam B will take different amounts of time to return.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the two "out-of-sync" beams recombined, they should create an <strong>interference pattern</strong> (a "fringe pattern"). If they then <em>rotated the entire machine by 90°</em>, the roles of the arms would swap, and the fringe pattern should <em>visibly shift</em>.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">3. 😱 The Shocking "Null Result"</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Here's what they found:
                </p>
                <p class="text-3xl font-bold text-center text-red-600 my-6">
                    Absolutely nothing.
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li>There was no initial interference pattern.</li>
                    <li>There was no "fringe shift" when the machine was rotated.</li>
                    <li>There was no change when they tried the experiment at different times of the year.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    This is the <strong>"null result."</strong> It meant there was no "aether wind" to detect. This was a profound crisis for physics.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    The "null result" was a puzzle. But Albert Einstein took a radical approach. Instead of trying to save the aether, he made the null result a <strong>foundational principle</strong> of his new theory.

                    This is the key application for your IB course. If you accept the M-M result (that `c` is constant), you are <em>forced</em> to conclude that space and time themselves must be flexible.

                    <li>As the interferometer moves, the light (Beam B) has to travel a <em>longer, diagonal path</em> to catch the moving mirror.</li>

                    <li>Since `c` is constant (from M-M) and the light traveled a <em>longer distance</em>, it <strong>must have taken more time</strong>.</li>
